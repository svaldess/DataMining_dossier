# Data Mining Dossier

This repository includes some of my data mining projects and excercises, including:

### Mining the video games global market data: web scraping and analysis
This project explores the growth of the global gaming industry. Using a **web scraping** code, the data was extracted from a video game sales tracking website.
**Python** was used for cleaning, processing and analyzing the data. **Plotly** was used for data visualization.

### A decade of cancer trends in the U.S.
This project offers a broad picture of the major trends of cancer types in the U.S. between 2006 and 2016, as well as the most common cancer types in terms of incidence and mortality. 
The data was retrieved from the United States Cancer Statistics. **Python** was used for cleaning, processing and analysing the data. **Matplolitb** and **Seaborn** were used for data visualization.

### Building a KNN classifier from scratch
This is a **KNN model** built with **Python** from scratch to predict diabetes on women. **10-fold cross validation** is performed to test the model.
