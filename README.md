# Data Mining Dossier

This repository includes some of my data mining projects and exercises, including:

### Mining the video games global market data: web scraping and analysis
This project explores the growth of the global gaming industry. Using a **web scraping** code, the data was extracted from a video game sales tracking website.
**Python** was used for cleaning, processing and analyzing the data. **Plotly** was used for data visualization.

### A decade of cancer trends in the U.S.
This project offers a broad picture of the major trends of cancer types in the U.S. between 2006 and 2016, as well as the most common cancer types in terms of incidence and mortality. 
The data was retrieved from the United States Cancer Statistics. **Python** was used for cleaning, processing and analysing the data. **Matplolitb** and **Seaborn** were used for data visualization.

### Predicting heart failure with a KNN classifier
First, by building a **KNN classifier** from scratch, this notebook aims at predicting heart failure while illustrating how KNN algorithm works. The KNN model performs **10-fold cross validation** to test the model. In a second part, **Sklearn KNeighbors Classifier** is used to illustrate how fast we can perform classification based on KNN with a few lines of code.
