# A decade of cancer trends in the U.S. (2006-2016)
## #Python #Matplotlib #Seaborn

Cancer has a major impact in the United States population. Statistics about cancer provide a picture of the burden of cancer on society in a specific period. They help us identify trends and patterns across the population, as well as among specific groups defined by sex, age, race (or ethnic group), geographic location, or other categories. Understanding cancer statistics is crucial for developing effective public policies and, therefore, addressing the challenges that cancer poses to society.

The main objectives of this project are:

* To identify the states with the highest incidence and mortality cancer rates.
* To identify the most common cancer types in terms of incidence and mortality in 2016.
* To identify the most common cancer types by sex, race and age.

## About the source

Data was retrieved from the [United States Cancer Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/uscs/about/index.htm). These statistics include cancer registry data from CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, as well as mortality data from CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. 

## About the project

This project was part of an assignment from Introduction to Data Mining class at GWU in Fall 2019.
**Python 3.7.4** was used for cleaning, processing and analysing the data. **Matplolitb** and **Seaborn** were used for data visualization.


## Key findings

_**Overall cancer trends:**_

- Data suggests that the South and Northeast regions seem to have higher incidence and mortality.
- The top 3 most common cancer sites in 2016 were: Lung and Bronchus, Prostate, and Female Breast Cancer. This has not changed since 2006.
- By analyzing total incidence, Female Breast cancer shows an upward trend from 2006 to 2016, as opposed to Lung and Bronchus, and Prostate. In a 10-year period, Female Breast has become the cancer site with the highest incidence.
- In 2016, mortality by Female Breast cancer accounted for more than 13% of total mortality by cancer. More important, mortality by Female Breast cancer shows an upward trend between 2006 to 2016.

_**Female Breast cancer:**_

- Data suggests that mortality caused by Female Breast cancer might have a bigger impact in the ‘black race’ group (female population).
- Similarly, the ‘black race’ category has bigger mortality rates across different groups of age, in comparison to other categories. By contrast, the ‘Asian/pacific islander’ category has the smallest mortality rates.
- By analyzing percentage rates of incidence rates, only 2 states registered a drop between 2006 and 2016. The District of Columbia has registered a significant drop of incidence rate of Female Breast cancer between 2006 and 2016 (more than 15% drop).
- In contrast, percentage rates of mortality rates reflect a different situation. The majority of the states in the U.S. registered a fall in mortality rates between 2006 and 2016.
- New Hampshire has the largest incidence rate of Female Breast cancer in 2016.
